What is Tinker?

Tinker is a REPL(read-eval-print loop). REPL allows you to interact with your application through command-line. It’s commonly used for making simple database changes.

Using Tinker, we can write actual PHP code through command-line. For instance, you need to add dummy data in your database table and you don’t have access to the database. In such case, you can insert data through Tinker. We can even update, delete table records in the database.
