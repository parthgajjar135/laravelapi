Creating cookies in Laravel we use Cookie::make() method and for reading cookie we use Cookie::get() method. Basically the Cookie::get() method is a wrapper over Request::cookie().

All cookies created by the Laravel framework are encrypted and signed with an authentication code, meaning they will be considered invalid if they have been changed by the client.

Creating a new Cookie

$cookie = Cookie::make($name, $value, $minutes, $path, $domain,$secure, $httpOnly);


Creating A Cookie That Lasts Forever


$cookie = Cookie::forever('name', 'value');

To create a cookie that won’t expire for 60 minutes


$cookie = Cookie::make('name', 'value',60);


To create a cookie that will expire on browser close


$cookie = Cookie::make('name', 'value');




Retrieving Cookie
cookie::get() method will return null if cookie not present with the given name and you can pass a default value as a second parameter.
